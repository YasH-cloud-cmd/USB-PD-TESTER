# USB-PD-TESTER
A compact USB Power Delivery trigger tool using the CH32X035 microcontroller. This custom hardware design negotiates USB-C PD voltages (5V to 20V) and displays the result via an OLED screen. Designed for quick testing of USB-C chargers and PD sources. Firmware sourced from wagiminator, PCB layout and modifications done by me.
