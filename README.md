## 🧠 What This Is

This project is a hardware-focused adaptation of the original [CH32X035 USB PD Tester](https://github.com/wagiminator/CH32X035-USB-PD-Tester).  
I redesigned the PCB to suit my workflow, added better headers, and ensured fabrication is smooth with Indian PCB vendors.

## 🧩 My Contributions

🔧 **Custom PCB Design**  
- Redesigned layout with clearer silkscreen, compact routing, and tested trace widths  
- Added debug headers (UART/SWD) for future firmware hacking  
- Re-aligned buttons and OLED screen for better usability and assembly

📸 **Testing and Assembly**  
- Fabricated via local Indian vendors (multi-layer process verified)  
- Soldered and tested with 65W USB-C PD charger  
- Measured real-time voltage switching on OLED display
